<p>
     The Elves Dynamic Travel Folder is a multi-agent system that can monitor
 various aspects of a trip for travelers.
Elves monitoring agents provide immediate notification of changes and cancellations
through the user's preferred notification device such as a text message to 
a cellular phone or e-mail.
There are existing commercial systems that provide small pieces of
these various capabilities, but our technology and application
is unique in providing a complete end-to-end solution for a trip.
For example, the <i>Flight-Status</i> monitoring agent
sends a fax to the hotel if the user's flight arrives late at night
so that the reserved room will not be given away.  
</p>

<p>
This project was funded by the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil">Defense Research Advanced Project Agency (DARPA)</a>, <a href="http://coabs.globalinfotek.com">Control of Agent-based Systems (COABS) program </a>.

This document describes how to use our system to monitor your own trip.

<h2> &nbsp; &nbsp;Agent Description</h2>

<p>

<!--
1. Air fare monitoring agent 
	Input : airline, flight number, from (city or airport code), to, date, user
	Action : notifies the user if the price drops for more than a certain amount (e.g. $50)

2. Flight schedule monitoring agent
	Input : airline, flight number, from (city or airport code), to, date, user
	Action : notifies the user if the scheduled time changes

3. Flight status monitoring agent
	Input : airline, flight number, from, date, user
	Action : notifies the user if the flight is cancelled or delayed

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Agent Name</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Task Description</td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Flight-Status</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
The <i>Flight-Status</i> monitoring agent uses the 
<a href="http://www.itn.com">ITN Flight Tracker</a> site 
to retrieve the current status of a given flight.
If everything is normal, it will assure the user approximately two
hours before the departure time by sending a message that the
flight is on time.  
If the user's flight is delayed or canceled it sends an alert through
the user's preferred devices, for instance, an email or a text message
to a cellular phone. If the flight is delayed by more than an hour,
the agent sends a fax to the car rental counter to confirm the user's
reservation. If the flight is going to arrive at the destination
airport after 5 PM, the agent sends another fax to the hotel so that
the reserved room will not be given away.

<!-- notifies the user if the flight is cancelled or delayed -->
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Airfare</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
The airlines change prices unpredictably, but the user can request a
refund if s/he finds out that the price has dropped.  The 
<i>Airfare</i> monitoring agent uses the <a href="http://www.orbitz.com">Orbitz</a> site to
gather the current price for a given itinerary. The agent notifies the
user if the price drops by more than a given threshold.
<!-- notifies the user if the price drops for more than a certain amount (e.g. $50) -->
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Flight-Schedule</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
Sometimes the scheduled departure time of a flight changes. This
changes happen only occasionally and the change is usually minor, but
when it does occur the traveler should know about them. The 
<i>Flight-Schedule</i> monitoring agent also uses the 
<a href="http://www.orbitz.com"> Orbitz </a> site to track
this information, and notifies the user if there is any change.

<!-- notifies the user if the scheduled time changes -->
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Earlier-Flight</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
If the user customarily switches flights, the <i>Earlier-Flight</i>
monitoring agent can come in handy.  This agent again uses the 
<a href="http://www.orbitz.com">Orbitz</a>
site to find the flights that leave earlier than the scheduled
flight. It shows the alternative flights and their
status. This information becomes extremely useful when the
scheduled flight is significantly delayed or cancelled.

<!--notifies the user if there are flights leaving earlier than the user's 
scheduled flight along with their current status.-->
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Flight-Connection</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
The <i>Flight-Connection</i> agent tracks the user's current flight,
and a few minutes before it lands, it sends the user the gate and
status of the connecting flight. This agent can also reuse the 
<i>Earlier-Flight</i> agent and provide gates and status of earlier flights.
 </td></tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">Restaurant-Finder (Coming soon)
</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
The <i>Restaurant-Finder</i> agent locates the user based on either a
Global Positioning System (GPS) device or his/her expected location
according to the plan. A half an hour before the user's regular meal
time, it suggests five closest restaurants together with cuisine type,
price range, street address, phone number, latitude, longitude, and
distance from the user's current location.

<h2> &nbsp; &nbsp;How to add a New Task</h2>

<p>
First time user must <a href="http://www.isi.edu/teamcore/elves/">register</a> first. After you register, please enable your preferred notification devices (e.g. e-mail device). 
</p>
<p>
	     
     There are two ways to enter monitoring tasks to Travel Elves. 
     First, Phosphorus Portal 
     is a Web interface to all the currently available agents. 
     If you are a registered user, you may log on to the system and 
     enter new requests for your trip directly to each individual agent. 
     Phosphorus Portal provides an overall view of agents' capabilities 
     and activity history. If you already made reservations and have all the necessary 
     information with you (e.g. Airline and flight number), you can use the Phosphorus interface. 
</p>
<p>     
     Another way to enter your requests is using 
     <a href="http://www.isi.edu/info-agents/heracles/">Heracles</a>. 
     You can interactively plan your trip using Heracles Travel Planner
     which can gather various kinds of travel related data,
     such as flights and hotel information. Heracles has already been integrated 
     with the Elves Travel system, and you can easily add or remove your monitoring tasks.

&nbsp;1. Phosphorus Portal: Meet the Elves!</a> </h3> 
<p>
Your email address is your ID in our system. You may leave the Password field empty. 
The first page shows all the available agents along with their brief capability description. 
For each agent in the list, there are two buttons: "Go" and "Recent and Past Responses".
Click <b>Go</b> button to go to the form interface to enter a new task. 
When you submit data Phosphorus interface will verify some data types,
and a popup window will notify you of the status of your request. An error message might be displayed 
in some rare circumstances. In such cases, simply resubmit the previous request.

<b>Recent and Past Responses</b> shows the message traffic for current and past tasks.
For instance, the Flight-Status agent notified you that your United flight 200 
was cancelled on January 10, 2002, and so on. Click the icon below to meet the Elves!

</li>

<li><p> If you already know the Airport codes, simply type in the codes, and choose the date and time of departure and arrival. Please note that we currently support only round trip with one stop or less. 
</p></li>

<li><p> Once the flight data is filled, the system will monitor everything by default. If you would like to cancel some of the tasks, simply click "Stop Monitoring" button for the specific task. 
The slot "Task Entered" shows the status of the tasks whether or not the task is successfully entered to the system. If it says "Entered", it means everything went fine, otherwise, you may try entering the task again by clicking "Stop Monitoring" first and then "Monitor" button. 
</p></li>

<li><p> At the bottom, there is a slot labeled as "View all Tasks". If you click the slot and type a tab key or an enter key, it will popup an Internet Explorer 
to show all the travel related tasks. You can also cancel any unwanted tasks through that page.
