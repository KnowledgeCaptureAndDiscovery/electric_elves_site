<p>
The operation of a human organization requires dozens of everyday tasks
to ensure coherence in organizational activities, to monitor the status
of such activities, to gather information relevant to the organization,
to keep everyone in the organization informed, etc.  Teams of software
agents can aid humans in accomplishing these tasks, facilitating the
organization's coherent functioning and rapid response to crises, while
reducing the burden on humans. Based on this vision, this paper reports
on Electric Elves, a system that has been operational, 24/7, at
our research institute since June 1, 2000.
</p>
<p>
Tied to individual user workstations, fax machines, voice, mobile
devices such as cell phones and palm pilots, Electric Elves has assisted
us in routine tasks, such as rescheduling meetings, selecting presenters
for research meetings, tracking people's locations, organizing lunch
meetings, etc.  There are a number of underlying AI technologies that
support the Electric Elves, including technologies devoted to
agent-human
interactions, agent coordination, accessing multiple heterogeneous
information sources, dynamic assignment of organizational tasks, and
deriving information about organization members.
</p>

<!---
Future large-scale human organizations will be highly agentized
to enhance their ability to act swiftly, coherently, and robustly in attaining
their goals.  This agentization requires a large organization of heterogeneous
software agents to carry out a wide variety of tasks in close concert with the
appropriate human users.  Moreover, such agentization would enable
dynamic teaming of humans and resources for accomplishing
organizational missions and responding to unanticipated crises. The
scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of a human organization provide a
rich source of research problems for agent technology. The research
done by the <B>Electric Elves</B> project at USC/ISI is focusing on an
integrated effort for dynamic team formation and crisis response in
complex organizations. Our research addresses three of the problems
that arise in the context of dynamic teaming: adjusting the software
agent's autonomy when acting on behalf of a human user; ontology-based
matchmaking for representing and reasoning about the capabilities of
humans; and automatically extracting and matching representations of
the interests of humans.</P>

<P>A key exciting aspect of the <B>Electric Elves</B> project is
the industrial-strength visitor hosting system, for regular deployment
at USC/ISI. This application enables us to address research issues in
a real-world context, while also helping us accomplish our missions,
e.g., system demonstrations outside USC/ISI.</P>

<P>Rapid integration of such distributed, heterogeneous agents via a
novel teamwork-based agent integration framework. In this framework,
software developers first specify an agent organization through
team-oriented programming. To recruit agents for this organization, an
agent resources manager (an analogue of a "human resources
manager") searches for agents of interest to this organization, and
monitors their performance over time. Agents in this organization are
wrapped with TEAMCORE wrappers, that make them team ready, and thus
ensure robust, flexible teamwork among the members of the newly
formed organization. This implemented framework promises to reduce
the software development effort in agent integration while providing
robustness due to its teamwork-based foundations. We have successfully
demonstrated this framework in a NEO TIE as part of the DARPA Control
of Agent-based Systems (COABS) program.</P>

<P>
To address the problems of accessing and verifying information from
heterogeneous soures, we developed a set of techniques for learning to
recognize the content of the required information.  The capability
makes it possible to automatically access and maintain wrappers to
extract data from online sources.  It also provides semantic
interoperability among software agents: to verify information from
other agents, identify semantic mismatches in data, as well as
automatically determine the type of information being communicated by
an agent.

<!---Ariadne system is part of the Web information integration project
at ISI. Information extraction is a major component of the project. We are
developing machine learning and statistical text analysis techniques
to facilitate information extraction.
