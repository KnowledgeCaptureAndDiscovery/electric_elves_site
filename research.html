<p>
Many activities of a human organization are well-suited for software
agents, which can devote significant resources to perform these tasks,
thus reducing the burden on humans. Indeed, teams of such software
agents could assist all organizations, including disaster response
organizations, corporations, the military, universities and research
institutions.
</p>
<p>
Based on the above vision, we have developed a system called the
Electric Elves that applies agent technology in service of the
day-to-day activities of the Intelligent Systems Division of
USC/ISI. Electric Elves is a system of about 15 agents, including nine
proxies for nine people, plus two different matchmakers, one flight
tracker and one scheduler running continuously for past several
months. This paper discusses the tasks performed by the system, the
research challenges it faced and its use of AI technology in overcoming
those challenges.
</p>
<p>
A key contribution of our work is understanding the challenges faced
in deploying agents to support organizations. In particular, the
complexity inherent in human organizations complicates all of the tasks
agents must perform.  First, since agents must interact with humans,
issues of  adjustable autonomy become critical.  In particular,
agents acting as proxies for people must automatically adjust their own
autonomy, e.g., avoiding critical errors, possibly by letting people
make important decisions while autonomously making the more routine
decisions.  Second, to accomplish their goals, agents must be provided
reliable access to information.  Third, people have a wide variety of
capabilities, interests, preferences and engage in many different tasks.
</p>
<p>
To enable teaming among such people for crisis response or other
organizational tasks, agents acting as their proxies must represent and
reason with such capabilities and interests.  We thus require powerful
matchmaking capabilities to match both interests and capabilities.
Fourth, coordination of all of these different agents, including
proxies, is itself a significant research challenge. Finally, the entire
agent system must scale-up: 
<font class=basic>
<ul>
<li> It must scale-up in the sense of 
	running continually 24 hours a day 7 days a week (24/7) for months at a
time 
<li> It must scale-up in the number of agents to support
	large-scale human organizations.
</ul>
</font>
</p>

<!------
<P>Future large-scale human organizations will be highly agentized,
with software agents supporting the traditional tasks of information
gathering, planning, and execution monitoring, as well as having
increased control of resources and devices (communication and
otherwise). As these heterogeneous software agents take on more of
these activities, they will face the additional tasks of interfacing
with people and sometimes acting as their proxies. Dynamic teaming of
such heterogeneous agents will enable organizations to act
coherently, to robustly attain their mission goals, to react swiftly
to crises, and to dynamically adapt to events. Advances in this
agentization could potentially assist all organizations, including
the military, civilian disaster response organizations, corporations,
and universities and research institutions.</P>

<P>Within an organization, we envision that agent-based technology
will facilitate (and sometimes supervise) all collaborative
activities. For a research institution, agentization may facilitate
such activities as meeting organization, paper composition, software
development, and deployment of people and equipment for out-of-town
demonstrations. For a military organization, agentization may enable
the teaming of military units and equipment for rapid deployment, the
monitoring of the progress of such deployments, and the rapid
response to any crises that may arise. In the service of these
collaborations, agent proxies will automatically take actions on
behalf of the various entities in the human organization to ensure
the success of the collaboration, while also reducing the amount of
effort required of the human members. To maximize the benefit of
these agent proxies, they must effectively manage the full range of
scenarios that occur within human organizations.</P>

<P>Specifically, there is one class of challenging scenarios in
such an agentized organization, namely the task of recruiting agent
teams and managing small-scale deployments of people and equipment to
respond to needs both planned and unanticipated. We envision
providing an agent proxy for each and every element of the human
organization. These agent proxies dynamically volunteer for team
membership on behalf of the humans or resources they represent, while
also ensuring that the selected team collectively possesses
sufficient resources and capabilities. The proxies must also manage
the team by ensuring the availability of appropriate resources
throughout the mission, the efficient transportation of such
resources, the monitoring of the progress of individual participants
and of the mission as a whole, and the execution of corrective
actions when goals appear to be endangered. Crises may emerge during
such missions, at which point the organization will dynamically
recruit the appropriate agents into a crisis response team. Such a
team will divide up responsibilities and monitor progress,
dynamically adjusting team membership as required.</P>

<P>The complexity inherent in human organizations complicates all
of these tasks and provides a challenging research testbed for agent
technology. First, the domain of human collaboration is highly
dynamic, making it impossible to predict what new tasks may arise and
how existing tasks may change during the course of a human
organization's operation. Second, humans, as well as their associated
tasks, are also very heterogeneous. The humans themselves have a wide
variety of capabilities, interests, preferences, etc. Third, human
organizations operate on a large scale, with large numbers of agents,
groups, tasks, etc. Human organizations operate on a large temporal
scale as well, requiring support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for
years. Finally, the members of the human organization place stringent
accuracy demands on the software agents that will be acting on their
behalf. For instance, a human's agent proxy should not take any
actions that conflict with the human's wishes, requiring the software
agent to maintain an accurate representation of the human's
preferences, capabilities, and constraints. These properties lead to
a wide range of research problems, from interface design to internal
representation languages, covering both single-agent and multi-agent
issues including:<br>

<ul>
<li>adjusting the autonomy of the agent organization when acting as
proxies for the corresponding humans
<li>using ontology-based matchmaking to allow the agent proxies to
represent and reason about the heterogeneity of the human agents and
their capabilities.
<li>methods for automatically generating textual and conceptual
descriptions of the interests of human agents and identifying those
agents who share common interests.<br>
</ul>

<P><font size="+1"><b>Visitor Hoster scenario<br>
</b></font>

<P>The <B>Electric Elves </B>project has begun applying agent
technology to several of these research problems within the testbed
of our own Intelligent Systems Division of USC/ISI. Our
implementation of this research is focusing on the illustrative
scenario of hosting a visiting researcher, since this problem raises
many of the issues common to the general class of research
collaboration tasks within our division. To robustly execute such a
scenario, the agent organization must perform a variety of tasks,
including<br>

<ul>
<li>recruiting researchers interested in meeting with the visitor
<li>identifying appropriate demonstrations for the visitor to observe
<li>scheduling meetings and demonstrations
<li>reacting to dynamic changes (e.g., meetings run long)
<li>notifying the appropriate human members of these changes, etc.<br>
</ul>
